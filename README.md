# Overview
NeuVector Security Center Admin Console for the SUSE NeuVector Container Security Platform.

A viewable version of docs can be seen at https://open-docs.neuvector.com

The images are on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry. Use the appropriate version tag for the manager, controller, enforcer, and leave the version as 'latest' for scanner and updater. For example:
+ neuvector/manager:5.0.0
+ neuvector/controller:5.0.0
+ neuvector/enforcer:5.0.0
+ neuvector/scanner:latest
+ neuvector/updater:latest

Note: Deploying from the Rancher Manager 2.6.5+ NeuVector chart pulls from the rancher-mirrored repo and deploys into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace.
